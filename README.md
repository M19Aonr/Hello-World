### Hi Fetsek
Once you install the [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
Please do the following:
- Launch the application `git-bash`
- In the terminal window execute the following commands:
```bash
mkdir ~/IdeaProjects/
cd ~/IdeaProjects/
git clone https://github.com/M19Aonr/Hello-World.git
```
